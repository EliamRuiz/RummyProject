Purpose of Program : This program is a game of Rummy with custom rules dictated by professor OrdoÃ±ez. 

How to run the program?

    The program should be run in a terminal with java se 13 or newer with SDK 18 or newer. The commands to properly run the program is :
        javac proj2.java 
        java proj2.java > output.txt 
    This commands will run the program, make the gui appear and also store the game session logs in a file saved in the project directory called output.txt. 

How to use the gui?

    The gui consists of two main columns of 4 buttons. One labeled for player one and the other for player two. The Stack button allows a player to grab a card from the stack of discarded cards if one is available. The deck button allows a player to get a card from the play sassion deck of cards. The lay button allows a player to lay on the table a group of cards he selected or a random one. The LayOnStack button allows a player to discard a card in the stack. Below each column lie the list of card thta each player has in the current hand. Below the column for player two there is a button for a very simple draw and discard automatic function from which the computer can have a game session with itself. Above the column for player one there is a line of text that indictes the current turn (the player to ehich t corresponds to) and it will interactively change with the play session. In the middle top there is the stack of cards and below it the deck of cards. 

How can you win?

    A player wins when he manages to get a hand of empty cards. Which means he has zero points (the player with least points wins teh game). Or if the deck runs out of cards then the player with the least amount of points on hand wins.The GUI will let the players know when this happens by poping a window with the player points and winner (or tie) announcement in the middle of the screen. When the announcement window is closed the GUI finishes.
